This module can generate sentances with a random length from a range of words, or just a bunch of random letters.
It also contains an object for writing text out letter by letter at a specifiable speed and with a custom sound.

WARNING
For sounds Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is REQUIRED.
You can ONLY install the "dev" version if you have that.
